  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>These terms and conditions apply to the HolyBite app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Apkerooo (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.</p>

  <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

  <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p>

  <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>

  <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. You may incur data or roaming charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for such charges. If you are not the bill payer, we assume you have permission from them.</p>

  <p>The Service Provider cannot be held responsible for certain user-specific circumstances, such as your device running out of battery or being incompatible with future updates.</p>

  <h2>Updates & Modifications</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider may update the Application. You agree to accept updates when offered. They may also terminate the Application at any time without notice. If terminated, you must stop using and delete the Application from your device.</p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions periodically. Please review this page regularly. Changes will be posted here.</p>
